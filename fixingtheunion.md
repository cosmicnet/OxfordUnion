Fixing the Union - How did we go from Gladstone to Johnson?
===========================================================

Since joining the Union I've had a nagging thought that I've not been able to ignore. The Union is known as the place where the next generation of politicians are learning the craft of speaking and practising the skills required to succeed in politics. Gladstone put the Union on the map. The former Union president that went on to be prime minister of the UK four times, the most of any British prime minister. His statue stands proudly in Westminster and other sites in London.

Johnson on the other hand, has soured the Union's reputation to many, and didn't even finish his term. From reading the history of the Union, it's clear that Gladstone's Union was a very different place.

In Gladstone's era, 1830, there were no guest or celebrity speakers. The students only debated each other. This was also true for H. H. Asquith's presdiency in 1874. Asquith went on to be prime minister for 8 consecutive years. The first guest speaker didn't appear until 1888, and even by the 1920s there were still no more than 2 or 3 guest speakers per term [1].

Compare that to todays Union, where a single debate can have more than 5 guest speakers, and the term card is littered with celebrity speakers.

The Union was originally modelled on the British Parliament, with debates in British Parliamentary style. But whilst parliament has improved its scrutiny over the years with the development of a number of select committees [2-4], the union has embraced an ever growing celebrity culture. Where once anyone gunning for the president's chair would need to win members over in debates, and likely be held to account on any failings or incompetencies, modern candidates can hide behind the stream of solo speakers and events. Perfecting nothing more than their "hacking" skills, with pyradmin scheme deals for votes from people in the lower electoral ranks.

Now in its bicentenary, the Union is ripe for change. I've split these changes into 3 phases.

Phase 1 - Accountability
------------------------

What I propose herein is a plan to increase accountability which would limit the success of pure hacks, bring a new specticle to the members more akin to the original debates, and spell the end of uncontested elections.

The Union has an opaque disciplinary system that most members are completely unaware of. What's more, it's often bogged down with petty issues. Members have the ability to walk into any committee meeting and raise an issue, but this is a privilege that is seldomm used. Walking into these unfamiliar committee meetings can be a daunting task for even experienced members, let alone those fresh faces. They also risk all political capital they may have. When issues are raised they are ususally quickly dissmissed, just as the many complaints received through social or email are ignored.

Uncontested elections are becoming more common. With those in the know, believing they have nothing to gain by running against a candiate that (oft through various Game of Thrones-esc strategies) has already orchestrated a voting pyramid made up of the highest voted candidates at each level of the previous election. With each candidate's friends, and friends of friends, told exactly who to vote for on each level so that all the votes add up to an assured win.

The Union should look to parliament again for inspiration. The politicians of tomorrow should not be learning accountability, as Johnson did, sat in front of a Parliamentary select committee. They should be learning it here and now at the Union, with a Union select committee.

The select committee would be headed by the runner up for president. Who better to hold the president to account than the person who most wanted their job. The remainder would be made up of 2nd place for each officer position, secretary, then the 2 highest ranking runners up from both standing and secretaries committees.

It would act as a combination of HM's opposition and a parliamentary select committee. Its head would be the "leader of the opposition" in all but name, and they would hold the president, officers, secretary and standing committee to account. Multiple times each term (fortnightly or weekly?) there would be a specticle in the chamber, akin to prime minister's questions, where the leader of the select committee would stand up for member issues and highlight the terms failures.

This would need to done with suitable rules, pomp and ceremony to make it both functional and entertaining for members.

Picture this: The president and her officers enter the chamber to the usual applause, taking seat in their chairs on the dias. The standing committee enter taking seats on the left front benches (stage right), leaving space for 4. The secretaries committee would take up the back benches. The select committee enter taking seats on the right front benches (stage left). The RO and two officers enter and stand waiting in the centre of the chamber facing the president. The head of the select committee thumps the ballow box three times and says something in latin ("Answer our questions" or alike). 

The president, officers, and secretary leave their seats and go to sit on the front benches alondside the standing committee. As they move a member from the select committee delivers a joke (akin to the State Opening of Parliament). The RO and two officers then take the chairs with the RO now acting as speaker, having the two officers to consult on the rules during the exchange. When the time is up, the RO calls the end, leaves the seats, giving them back to the president and their officers. The president and officers make final statements to the chamber and the specticle ends.

Much fun could be had with this. Select committee members could be given chance to speak on issues important to them, regular members could be invited to speak themselves, or they could speak through the select committee head giving anonyminity and alaying fears of political retribution. The select committee would be motivated to represent the members issues, as for them, it could be a real vote winner for the next election. Failure to do so, would likely mean electoral disaster. Standing committee members could choose to defect to the select committee for the entirity of the exchange to speak on issues they are passionate about. Regular members would also have opportunity to speak, putting across their questions, complaints, and experiences in the Union.

The disinterested tones in response to issues at committee meetings would be replaced with the roar from members watching, much like in PMQs, such that they could no longer be ignored, and corrective steps be taken.

There would be accountabilty.

Hacks would find it much harder to rig the system. They couldn't line up one of their friends for head of the select committee without risking some of their own presidential vote. Pure hacks with low competency would soon be exposed, and the increased empowerment of members would surely do much damage to the voting pyramid schemes. 

Competency would be king once again, as it was in the early days of the Union. 

Within a generation, a positive impact could be had on British (and world) politics.

With luck this would also spell the end to negative oxfess and cherwell articles from those bitter to have lost their election.

Rules would be needed to govern the content of the exchanges such that they aren't personal attacks or allegations, but instead focus on the issues surrounding events, members, etc.


Phase 2 - Diversity of subjects
-------------------------------

It's fair to say that Humanities students run the Union, as a result many speakers and events inadvertently appeal more to Humanities students. Now, such students are likley to always dominate in a free speech society, however, students of other subjects should be catered for.

The UK government has a number of advisory committees and groups related to science (SAGE, etc.) [5] yet the Union has no science representation. Humanities students should be learning to interact and work with scientists here at the Union. A good start would be to introduce a Science and Technology officer on access committee, and potentially grow this later.

Senior members are often overlooked, and there are a great many of them in and around Oxford who used to use the Union regularly. Senior members have told me that there used to be a lot more collaboration between them and the committee. To re-introduce this, a Senior Officer role should be created on access committee.

SBS have a great many members who often feel like their particular interests are not being represented. Creating a Business Officer role on access committee could go some way to fix this. They would work in co-ordination with the SBS Union liason officer, or be the same person?


Phase 3 - Digital Transformation, Transparancy, Continuous Improvement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO this section needs to be fleshed out with more rationale and descriptions for those from a non technical background.

The Union has no coheisive digital strategy, this leaves members struggling to keep updated with changes to the term card, and getting answers to their various questions. UK goverment has a comprehensive strategy, so should the Union [6].

It's clear that the inconsistencies in social media/email/term card/etc., along with response rates to questions through the various channels, are due to hopelessly overloaded committee members and GO staff without any clear digital processes and support to ease the burden.

Digital member commications committee (?) with new IT officers (preferably with CompSci background) to help develop a strategy and guide existing social media roles.

Ticketing system to help ensure member messages get answered promptly, and statistics are tracked, whilst building up a FAQ. New committee members answering what they can and directing other tickets to the GO.

Digital calendar that can be synced to members regular calendars so they can be kept up to date with term card changes automatically.

Digital notice board.

Digital ballot system with transparent code and execution for complete fairness.

Feedback loops for events with metrics - measure, evaluate, improve.
